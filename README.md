## ðŸ§  Abstract
This paper reviews the integration of Data Distribution Service (DDS) in Smart Traffic Systems (STSs) across the last decade. It summarizes 37 studies and compares DDS against MQTT and CoAP in terms of latency, scalability, and QoS flexibility. The findings show DDS outperforms others in real-time applications, though it faces challenges in QoS tuning and security.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Contributions
- Reviews DDS-based STSs from 37 scholarly sources.
- Benchmarks DDS vs MQTT and CoAP.
- Outlines integration challenges and security issues.
- Proposes future research for real-time traffic solutions.
